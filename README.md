## Overview

I work in the Meat and Seafood department at Kroger and I am often responsible for giving customers fresh seafood upon their request. Many seafood products are hard to classify such as the difference between Atlantic Salmon and Sockeye Salmon. Although these products are labled, I still think it would be cool to train a CNN to classify different types of seafood.


## Obtaining Data

In order to collect the images to use as training data, I installed a chrome extension called Fatkun batch download image which allows you to download a whole page's worth of google images, about 400, at a time. For each class, type of fish in this case, I downloaded all the images available via google images, filtered out the less relevant images, nd put 80% in a test folder and 20% into a train folder. click on this link to view ad download the dataset via kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/spencerholley/seafood-images
